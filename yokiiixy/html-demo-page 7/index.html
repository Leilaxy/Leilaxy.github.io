            <h1>Meet</h1>
            <p>There are so many beautiful things around us to cherish and appreciate even without an extraordinary adventure.</p> 
            <p>As virtual reality and metaverse platforms continue to grow in popularity, I am interested in exploring the impact of these technologies on human identity. because of the rise of technology, which has led individuals to socialise and construct their identities in new and diverse ways. This shift has raised concerns about the real world. With metaspace threatening to replace the real world environment, what is left of our real world that is worthy of human attachment.</p>

                <h3>Images</h3>
                <p>I was inspired by the movie "Instant All Universe" which showcased a series of events that occurred in the multiverse, including one where a universe transformed into a sausage man and the entire universe evolved into sausages. This concept fascinated me. During the project, I spoke with my childhood friend who reminded me of the fantastical adventures we watched together as kids, providing me with tremendous inspiration. As a result, I treated my VR project as a realistic multiverse and incorporated my own childhood stories into it. I used my journey to Paris in search of my childhood friend as a guide for the VR universe. The virtual reality experience followed the same path as the real-world map, but the encounters and landscapes were different. I recorded the entire trip as a dataset and used machine learning algorithms to generate images for VR modeling. I introduced this process into the VR world as a timeline. Next, I utilized machine learning adversarial networks to process the recorded images and understand the computer's perspective. These scenes were linked together to construct a model of the VR environment. </p>
