            <h1>Shaping the Past</h1>
            <p>When we try to learn about history, fake historical images can make it really hard. Sometimes people use these fake pictures for politics, culture, or technology, and it makes it tough to know what the truth is. Throughout the world, cultural objects are one of the means by which people learn about history and are an important historical heritage. They are treasures of culture, art and human ingenuity that help people to understand the social, political and economic circumstances of the past. Many Greek sculptures, for example, have been damaged or have disappeared, due to natural disasters, wars, excavations and so on.  </p>

                <p>Destruction of sculptures has become a means for politicians to exercise power. For example, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, the Budisavci Monastery and the majority of mosques in Kosovo were damaged. Subsequently, Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević blamed the destruction on Albanians and used the incident to strengthen his territorial claims over Kosovo. To provoke contemplation among viewers about the potentially fictional power enabled by technological advancements, I utilized machine learning to generate images of destroyed sculptures. This work questions whether what we see and hear is genuine and raises awareness about the nature of truth in an age of manipulated media.</p>
