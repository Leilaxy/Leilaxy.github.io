            <p>"A world constructed from 0 and 1."</p> 
            <p>The impact of the digital world on our lives is extensive and far-reaching. It has revolutionised the way we communicate, work, learn and play. The foundation of this digital world lies in code, made up of zeros and ones. I used the unity engine face tracking technology , which will code models to track a person's face and overlay. I want to express the impact of the digital world in our lives in an intuitive way. The code is made up of zeros and ones, and when the code appears intuitively in any corner of our world, it covers our own appearance to simulate that in the digital world humans have gradually blurred themselves.</p>

                <p>The impact of the digital world on our lives is extensive and far-reaching. It has revolutionised the way we communicate, work, learn and play. The foundation of this digital world lies in code, made up of zeros and ones. Code plays a key role in countless applications, from software programs to electronic devices, and even to our social media and online shopping platforms. If all of a sudden these codes were to appear visually around us and confront us with their complexity and scale, our sense of reality and perception would be completely altered. They could overshadow our original true look and scale and make us feel small and helpless. I used the unity engine face tracking technology , which will code models to track a person's face and overlay. Four or five of these models were set up and the multi face tracking code was used to allow them to track faces randomly. This technique is a script for multi face tracking that uses AR Face Management from the AR Foundation to detect and track faces in the scene and place a randomly selected AR face model on each detected face. </p>
