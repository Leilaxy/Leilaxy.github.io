            <h1>Blossom</h1>
            <p>When I was a child I loved watching the Barbie series of films. In my childhood I thought that the flowers and butterflies inside the Barbie films were beautiful things in the world. In today's society, the pace of human life is increasing, more and more working people are suffering from mental illness and we are not as happy as we were in our childhood. So I bring the beauty of my childhood into the present and achieve self-healing</p>

                <p>Because I think there is a conceptual and non-realistic nature to the ar world, when we draw something we can transform it into a virtual reality that appears in our field of vision. It's a very interesting thing. It would be a lot less fun if it only existed in the device without any interaction with reality. For example, In Narduli Studio's La Raza, people's gestures change and so do the visual effects. So I started with the idea of a realistic brush, when I simply draw a few flowers and the device recognises the whole drawing and then anchors my model to the paper. To interact with the model, I made a click on the screen and the flowers will make a crisp sound and shake a little. There is a feedback when we touch them. They are like an interesting living thing. </p>
