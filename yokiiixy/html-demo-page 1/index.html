            <h1>LichenLingo</h1>
            <p>Lichens, those symbiotic organisms, frequently pioneer new territories as they establish themselves in the forefront of nascent ecosystems. In my research, I've conceptualized the human network activity as a nourishing substrate that fosters the growth of lichens. In this unique symbiosis, the flourishing of this novel lichen species is intricately linked to human online engagement.  </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <img id="striped-image" src="bujian.jpeg"/> 
                <p>This project serves as an experimental endeavor, the core of this project involves a unique mechanical transmission system, characterized by its INPUT employing Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) resistors and OUTPUT featuring SG90 servo mechanisms. In this innovative setup, the LDR resistors act as sensory receptors, responding to variations in ambient light intensity. When the light intensity is high, the micro servo will drive the spur gears to rotate, which has been done to open and close the growth state of a single lichen. This mechanical orchestration meticulously orchestrates the opening and closing of a single lichen's growth state, effectively modulating its response to environmental cues.The purpose is to abstract human influence into plant growth elements. Simultaneously, the project integrates computer vision through the Posenet technique in P5js. A PoseNet pose detector is initialized to capture human pose information from a computer camera, which is then transmitted to a Unity-based lichen model. This data is used to generate fictitious lichen names, with the generation speed directly correlated to human activity. Faster human movement results in quicker lichen name generation, while slower activity corresponds to a more leisurely naming process. The lichen names are randomly generated by adding the lichen naming features. Additionally, the pose data is relayed to Unity.</p>

                <p>In Unity, the lichen model's appearance is manipulated using shader techniques. This dynamic color effect is based on time and texture noise, with user-defined attributes such as speed, intensity, scale, color exponent, and random seed determining the color's appearance. Complementing this, C# scripts create a WebSocket server to facilitate communication between Unity objects and external data sources. This code establishes a WebSocket connection for data transmission, which is then used to update the appearance of objects within the Unity scene. Debug information is also displayed in the console to monitor the WebSocket communication and data processing processes. This project merges cutting-edge technology and biology, blurring the lines between human influence and plant growth elements, offering a unique and engaging exploration of these interwoven worlds.</p>
